How exciting it was to spend a day with Shirley talking nothing but dataViz!!
Yes, this was unique opportunity for some of us who registered to the 
[meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-d3-User-Group/events/252723783/) from bay area d3 user group. 

We got along in the first hand to recieve a presentation from Shirley on building custom data visualizations 
and subsequently chime in with our remarks on the nature of the slide contents and our suggestions. 
This was supposed to be main content for a frontend masters course on building custom data visualizations. 

Out of the time we spent, we went through foundational data visualization concepts that I learnt in the past as a 
part of my graduate curriculam and later from Tufte's 
[The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi), 
but I was surprised to learn newer interesting aspects when the same general principals that were 
discussed over table with people like [@sxywu](https://twitter.com/sxywu) & 
[@micahstubbs](https://twitter.com/micahstubbs). 

She called us the beta test subjects üòÅ for her upcoming workshop!

She also came back with her status on the [slides](//slides.com/shirleywu/deck-10/) based on some of our inputs.

Some of the nugets that I would definetly apply on my upcoming visualizations are:
> - Gestalt Law of grouping applied with Enclosure highlighting chart area/channels encompasing the marks. *(examples in the slide)*
> - Well defined marks and channels in a visualization layout design lets us simplify overall design process. 
> - Breaking down the D3 API into Layout calculation, DOM manipulation, Annotation and Interaction layers helps in building D3 apps with frameworks like React where the DOM manipulations can be handed over to react for example.

There are more such pieces that can help better ones workflow of building custom data visualizations from the 
following slides:
