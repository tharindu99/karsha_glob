Information Visualization is a marriage of multiple disciplines such as Psychology, 
Human Computer Interaction and Data Science, which again includes Computer Science, 
and Statistics! So they’re many reasons to be intrigued by its sheer depth and this post 
quickly gives a glimpse of Psychological aspect of Information Visualization.

In terms of our visual apparatus, we’re not as good at judging differences in certain parameters 
and NOT good at some and Stevens’ Power Law gives us a quick way to measure this phenomenon.

### Stevens’ Power Law
The general form of the law is
                                `ψ(I)=kIa`,
where `I` is the magnitude of the physical stimulus, `ψ(I)` is the subjective magnitude of the 
sensation evoked by the stimulus, a is an exponent that depends on the type of stimulation and `k` 
is a proportionality constant that depends on the units used.

Charting this out gives us an interesting array of stimulus and from the below image one can generalize 
the stimulus exaggeration that happens with the responses below the line (Length n=1.0) namely area, 
loudness and brightness. This means the change in these parameters (area, loudness and brightness) 
is in some way underestimated by the human perception and the reverse is true for the upper side of the line. 
This is why we give careful consideration while designing an infographic with colors and their brightness. 

### Case: Length vs Area
From Stevens’ Power Law we can immediately conclude that we’re not as good at judging differences area as we 
are in length. We use length as a means to judge sizes and therefore tend to underestimate differences in areas 
especially of the circles.

For this reason, a circle that actually has 3x the area of another appears comparable because our brain is 
relating their radii, which differ by a factor of 1.72x.Here are some more proofs of controled experiments 
at [Stanford HCI Labs](https://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs448b/w09/lectures/20090126-Perception.pdf)

But over time this concept has come to a point where the community has lead to believe the circular shapes are
less efficient in encoding the data:

On the contrary there are advocates who make more sense to me for example, [@kennelliott](https://twitter.com/kennelliott) 
in her presentation explains that 50% of a controled group followed the outer arc of a pie 
chart to read the metric and only 25% followed the area & more importantly a majority of the group prefered a Pie!!

So perception is a subjective science that can be discussed further but I would simply take into account the following 
simple guide to chose my design channels.
